## Major Findings

Our study found that:
1. **Order Effects**: The order in which cookies were presented did not significantly affect taste ratings.
2. **Verbal Information**: Providing verbal information about the quality of the cookies had a minimal impact on participants' taste preferences.
3. **Visual Information**: Packaging and visual branding had a significant impact on taste preferences, with participants rating cookies higher when they saw the packaging.
4. **Combined Effects**: The combination of verbal and visual information had the most substantial effect on consumer preferences, highlighting the powerful role of branding.
